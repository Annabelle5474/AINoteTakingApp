In the chapter "What's wrong with automated influence," Claire Benn and Seth Lazar speak about the exploitation discourse revolving around the concept of automated Influence. Benn and Lazar define automated Influence as the use of AI to collect information about the User and use the information to shape the actions they make, citing that the main idea of their definition revolves around "collections, integration, and analysis of user data." (Benn and Lazar 127). In principle, the goal of automated Influence is for Users to gain some benefit while the provider uses some way to make a profit. However, automated Influence is easily susceptible to the negative side. Automated Influence can be used in other ways that harm users. One way provided by Been and Lazar is exploitation. Companies can use the data they collect from Automated Influence to push Users to make unfavorable decisions. Companies can utilize exploitation because they have taken advantage of the Users' ability to coordinate and make accurate decisions. In doing so, the User has pretty much accepted being controlled by the company, and it can be taken advantage of. Through exploitation, Companies can push users to make transactions/decisions they would not usually make. A way to combat exploitation Benn and Lazar offer is for the Users to ask for more power from the Sellers. By demanding more power, The Users gain more knowledge of such a situation, making it likely for exploitation. Another way Companies can harm users is through manipulation. Benn and Lazar define

manipulation as "undermining an individual's decision-making power" (Benn and Lazar 139). Benn and Lazar explain that automated Influence is prone to manipulation since there is a possibility that it could target someone's weakness in order to push an agenda or a product. Targeting a weakness is considered manipulation since it undermines their decision-making through their emotions. Benn and Lazar cover two types of manipulation: online and stochastic. Online manipulation includes a company's ways to grab your attention; it all depends on whether the result is more harm than good. Stochastic manipulation focuses on undermining a group's decision-making. Benn and Lazar provide the election as an example; one or two percent make a massive difference in an election, so targeting groups is a way to garner more attention. With all these harmful ways Companies can use consumers, Benn and Lazar conclude that the way to fix it is for consumers to get more power. Getting more power requires someone at a company needing much power, but if that power is given, it just causes the likelihood of companies taking advantage to be higher. 
In the article, "Amazon hides cheaper items with faster delivery, lawsuit alleges," by Ashley Belanger, talks about a lawsuit that accuses Amazon of tricking users into purchasing more expensive items for faster delivery times and claims there are cheaper items with the same amount of delivery time. The lawsuit primarily revolves around Amazon's algorithm of the buy box, the component that is supposed to provide the User with the best deals available. However, Belanger claims the algorithm implemented by Amazon holds a bias. Allegedly, the Buy Box holds bias towards FBA Sellers (The Fulfillment by Amazon), and these Sellers pay Amazon fees to appear on the Buy Box. In doing so, Amazon pushes the Seller's deals to Users of Amazon under the false assumption that these are the best deals available. As a result, numerous

lawsuits have been filed against Amazon. The article primarily focuses on the lawsuits of Jeffery Taylor and Robert Selway, who are both long-time users of Amazon. They claim Amazon's black box has deceived them and seek compensation from Amazon because of damage caused to the consumers using their website. The lawsuit speaks for all Users harmed by the algorithm, claiming that the chances a user of Amazon was unharmed are virtually non-existent, citing "hundreds of millions of Amazon consumers" ( Amazon hides cheaper items with faster delivery, the lawsuit alleges) have used the buy box. Belanger concludes that the damage done by Amazon is unknown, but based on their revenue, it appears to be a significant amount, and such actions were caused by Amazon's plan to keep prices high. 
Benn and Lazar's analysis of exploitation revolves around the company's ability to undermine the decision making process of a User. They claim that companies take advantage of the consumers' ability to "act in a coordinated and purposeful way" (Benn and Lazar 138). By doing so, companies can undermine the User's decision-making ability, thus increasing their control and reducing the User's overall scope. That being said, Benn and Lazar would agree that Amazon is exploiting its Users. One reason for the agreement is a similarity between the Buy Box and Benn And Lazar's point of incoordination. Other than the Buy Box's general purpose, it has yet to be known to the public how the internal components of the algorithms are. The Users being deprived of this knowledge makes them subject to exploitation by Amazon. One of the solutions Benn and Lazar offer for exploitation is for Users to demand "resources, knowledge, and power." (Benn and Lazar 138). Knowledge is the critical factor as Many Users do not have an internal understanding of the buy box as their knowledge is limited to "believe that featured items offer the best deals on the platform." ( Amazon hides cheaper items with faster delivery;

the lawsuit alleges) An example of how a company can take advantage of a User's lack of knowledge, showing how they needed more knowledge to make a fully fledged coordinated decision. Benn and Lazar would say Amazon exploits their Users by taking advantage of their incoordination about the Buy Box for Amazon's using the User's minimal scope about the buy box to their profit. Another Reason Benn and Lazar would agree with the claim of exploitation is that the nudging Amazon indirectly applies. A crucial part of Benn and Lazar's analysis is the company's depiction of you being the one in control as they promote "individual agency and control." (Benn and Lazar 138). Making it seem like you are in control gives users a sense of power and confidence when making decisions, which is why Users constantly use the Buy Box. The Buy Box was shown to be a tool Users can use to make the best decisions possible, giving them that entitled power. Amazon promotes itself as a "customer-centric company that works to offer the lowest prices to its customers" ( Amazon hides cheaper items with faster delivery, the lawsuit alleges), which further promotes the power Users have when buying something from Amazon. The false sense of control helps Amazon nudge Users into buying from the buy box, as it is promoted as a tool users can use to make decisions based on their interests. We can see the strategy's effectiveness as "Amazon's US sales exceeded 574 billion." ( Amazon hides cheaper items with faster delivery, the lawsuit alleges). The strategy of Amazon promoting itself to be a company that gives control to its Users has proven effective. Benn and Lazar would say Amazon's promotion of Individual control has allowed them to exploit users into utilizing the tools of Amazon to make decisions, when in reality, Amazon has undermined their decision-making process. To add on to other reasons, the final reason is because of Amazon’s exploitation of Resources. If one single individual was harmed by the incident, a large lawsuit

wouldn't happen and the matter would be much smaller; however, when it’s a collected group then it’s an issue. In Benn and Lazar’s analysis of exploitation another key factor was resources. Resources meaning the data that is collected. Data for individuals doesn’t hold a lot of value, however when put together it holds a lot of value. This is evident since the Buy Box’s algorithm has been able to produce large amounts of revenue for the company. The exploitation of Users’ data has worked as “98 percent of Amazon Sales” ( Amazon hides cheaper items with faster delivery, the lawsuit alleges), are done through the Buy Box. With more data available for Companies to Use, the Buy Box becomes more essential to Users since the large amount of data can be used to produce better results. While data may seem not to be exploitative, it gives the companies an advantage through the buy box because of the amount of data it has received, thus showing the exploitation behind the User’s Data. Benn and Lazar would say Amazon has used the data it’s collected to improve the algorithm to continue to exploit users in a more sophisticated manner.  
Overall, I believe Benn and Lazar would agree that Amazon exploits its Users, pointing out three main reasons. The first reason is limited information about the Buy Box since Amazon depicts the Buy Box to give the best deals to its users. There is no deep analysis of the Buy Box. Thus, the User's knowledge of the buy box is limited to what is presented. Secondly, Amazon is promoted to be an individual powered company. It gives users confidence in the decisions they make with Amazon. Thus, they use the Buy Box more. It gives the User a feeling of control when, in reality, it is Amazon pulling the Strings. Thirdly, the large amounts of data collected by amazon to give to the buy box, which in turn creates a better algorithm for the buy box to run on, giving the company the advantage. For these reasons, Benn and Lazar would agree that Amazon

has thoroughly exploited its Users through the Buy Box to earn more overall revenue for the company.
